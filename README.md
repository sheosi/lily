# lily

An efficient voice assistant for human beings.

Lily is written in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/)ü¶Ä  + [Python](https://www.python.org/)üêç.

## Obtaining Lily
Lily uses git [LFS](https://git-lfs.github.com/) which means it needs to be
cloned with that installed and ready beforehand.

First install git LFS, for *Debian/Ubuntu* it is:

```shell
sudo apt install git-lfs
```

On *Fedora*:

```shell
sudo dnf install git-lfs
```


Then, no matter which OS you are under you need to initialize git LFS:

```shell
git lfs install
```

Now, you can clone the repo:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/sheosi/lily
```

Alternatively, if you already have cloned the repository but did not had lfs 
installed, on the root folder of this folder do:

```shell
git lfs pull
```

And you'll be good to go.

## Building

### Dependencies

#### Dependencies needed at compile time and runtime:

*On Debian:*
```shell
sudo apt install libssl-dev libasound2-dev libpocketsphinx-dev libsphinxbase-dev python3-all-dev clang libgsl-dev
```

*On Fedora:*
```shell
sudo dnf install openssl-devel alsa-lib-devel pocketsphinx-devel python3-devel clang gsl-devel
```

*Optional* dependency for feature `extra_langs_tts` (Languages not provided by Pico Tts for local Tts):

*Debian*
```shell
sudo apt install libespeak-ng-dev
```

*Fedora*
```shell
sudo dnf install espeak-ng-devel
```

Note: The first time that you use a language it needs to be downloaded by the NLU, so it needs internet at that time. Also, installing them as system would make this download fail, and you would need to install the languages on your own, for english: `snips-nlu download en`

### Build process
Once you have at least the compile time dependencies you can compile lily, you'll
need [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) and cargo (bundled alongside Rust) for this.

`cargo build`

### Debian package
This repository can make a Debian package, however it is still dependent on 
`snips-nlu` and `fluent.runtime` python packages, though will try to install 
them on it's own.

To generate the Debian package.

```shell
cargo install cargo-deb
cargo deb
```

## Features

- [x] Overall shell: some user interfaces, stt, tts ...
- [x] Intent and slot parsing
- [x] Multilanguage
- [x] Client/Server architecture
- [ ] Question answering
- [ ] Semantic parsing
- [ ] Interactivity (asking for something after the initial trigger)

## Where will it run?
Lily is meant to be run on-device (mostly) even on constrained hardware like a Raspberry. Of course, it will still work on standard PCs and more powerful hardware.

## Current state:

* *Smartness*: Can trigger actions, with a dialog system on the works
* *Modularity*: Client and Server are their own processes, skills are getting the same treatment (getting compatibility with Hermes protocol)
* *Multilanguage* [Needs testing]: Can work with multiple languages and detect by voice which is being used. Detection is only made for voice (not text). Languages can`t be mixed in the same question.
